I developed this Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning, Python, used 1 csv file for the dataset which has been used in the project. From the dataset some special columns have been chosen for differentiating and analysing the similarities between all the movies provided in the dataset. For this Cosine similarity algorithm has been used.
